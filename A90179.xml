            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>MY LORD!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have received yours of the 9 of this month, with a copy of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Mazarines</hi> to you; upon which you are pleaſed to deſire my ſence, that you may not bee ignorant in a matter ſo neerly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, in relation to the charge you have from the King of <hi>France;</hi> nor to remit to act the part of an honeſt and faithfull ſubject, as you ſhall be commanded: yet you ſay, the keeping firm (as you are) to be the moſt advantagious courſe you can take, to avoid diſadvantage and diſhonour. The beſt way to comply with your deſire (as I underſtand it) will bee in the firſt place to ſet down what hath been done by me in obedience to the King my maſters command, upon which his Eminencie took a pretence to write that letter unto you. His Majeſtie about the beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> thought fit to imploy me about ſome affairs of his to his Highneſs <hi>Don John of Auſtria,</hi> and amongſt other things gave me order, upon all fitting opportunities to ſignifie unto any of his Subjects in the <hi>French</hi> ſervice, that his Majeſtie hath preſent vſe for them in his, and to require them to march to ſure places as I ſhould direct them; in purſuance of his order, upon the rendering of <hi>Condy,</hi> I made the Kings pleaſure known to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Muskery,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>James Darcy,</hi> who hereupon expreſt all poſſible duty unto his Majeſty, and all readineſs to obey his commands, as his moſt Loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and obedient Subjects; but they deſire in performance of that duty to have liberty to provide for their honour, by demanding diſmiſſion from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie; which they conceived could not be denied them (proviſion, being made in their capitulation for it, and for a months pay to their officers and ſouldiers at parting) I confeſs I neither was, nor am ſatisfied; yet that there was a neceſſity for that formality (their own Kings commands interpoſing and extending no farther, then to ſerve under his commiſſion and by his order and no other) but that they might very well diſpence with the demanding of Paſports, if they would quit their pretence to the months pay, and could reaſonably ſuſpect they would be broken in this, as they have been in other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, equally capitulated for by them; yet they perſiſting in their belief, that it was neceſſary, and engaging their honours to me, to demand their Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports;
<pb facs="tcp:168457:2"/>and (in caſe they ſhould be either granted or refuſed) to do what became them in Allegiance: I made no attempt to draw their officers or men from them. And this is what hitherto hath paſſed in that matter, except that I am lately aſſured that <hi>Muskery</hi> hath demanded his Paſs; but with what ſucceſs I cannot yet tell, howſoever I muſt conclude that his Eminencie (when he ſaid my ſolicitations had been ineffectual) either was not yet well informed, or intended not ſo much your information in the truth of that paſſage, as to corrupt the officers and ſouldiers of the Iriſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where you are, &amp; to diſpoſe them to diſobey their Kings order when they ſhould be ſent them, by laying before them a fained example of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience in others, which though it had been true, ought rather to bee detected then imitated.</p>
            <p>Of what concerns the King my maſters good Treatment in <hi>France</hi> (the continuance of a monthly aſſiſtance to him) from hence urged by the Cardinall to argue his Majeſtie of ingratitude, or me of indiſcretion or impoſture: I ſhall not ſay more then that his Majeſtie is well known, to be of a nature much more inclined to forget injuries then benefits; &amp; that it falls not within the Sphere of my buſineſs, to know when or whence he received moneys: but that my proceedings at <hi>Condy</hi> were warranted and approved, will evident unto you by the incloſed copy of the order. His Majeſtie ceſent to Collonel <hi>Muskery,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>James Darcy;</hi> and by thoſe which the officers with you may in due time receive, ſo that I cannot but wonder ſo great and wiſe a Miniſter as his Eminency ſhould (to ſerve any preſent turn how importunate ſoever) make uſe of ſuch Artifices as are not onely liable to preſent and palpable detection and refutation, but ſuch as are alſo in the beſt degree injurious to the honour and reputation of a ſervant, that hath punctually obſerved, and not exceeded his maſters commands. I think I know what is due from me to the firſt miniſter of a great King; I am ſure there is no man upon all occaſions ſhall treat him with more reſpect, but then I ſhall expect to be treated as a Gentleman, and not to be charged with an indiſcreet zeal, nor with acting without warrant through partiality to the Spaniard, and to the diſſervice of my Maſter, as I am by his Eminency; to whom as I ow no account of my diſcretion, ſo I take him alwaies to be an incompetent judg of my fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; at this time no very proper inſtrument for what is good or bad for my Maſters ſervice: And ſince he hath bin pleaſed to uſurp an authority to judge and condemne me with circumſtances of calumny, uncivilly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Miniſter of one Prince, to the ſervant of another. I conceive it gives me juſt ground to put you in minde, that by his miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:168457:2"/>an Alliance is made betwixt France, and the Murderers of a juſt and lawful King; and that not onely without neceſſity, but upon ſuch infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conditions, as no neceſſity can juſtifie: As for inſtance, the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of France diſpoſſeſt Princes, the Grandchildren of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth: Adde to this, that his Eminencie is the Inſtrument of ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, as gives countenance and ſupport to the uſurpers of the rights of Kings, to the Profeſſed perſecutors of the Catholicks, and to the deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your nation; and to thoſe, by whom the Nobility and Gentry of it are maſſacred at home, and led into ſlavery, or driven to beggery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; and then you will be no longer of an opinion, that it can be conſiſtent with honour of advantage for any of the Kings ſubjects (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Iriſh Nation) to be flattered or bribed by the Cardinal from the duty they owe to their natural King and their deſolate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. By this time your Lordſhip may conceive my ſence of that Letter, upon which you deſire it; and as you have done me a very great favour in ſending it to me; ſo if it pleaſe you to make this Letter of mine as publick as that of his Eminencies hath been, you will (by an act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) oblige me to continue</p>

            <p>THe obligations and many inſtances of affection which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from your Eminence, do engage me to make returns ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; commenſurate to your merits, But although I have this ſet home upon my ſpirit, yet I may not (ſhall I tell you, I cannot) at this juncture of time (and as the face of my affairs ſtands now) anſwer to your Call for Toleration; I ſay I cannot, as to a publick declaration of my ſence in that point; although I believe, that under my Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your Eminence in the behalf of Catholicks, has leſſe reaſon for complaint, as to rigour upon men's conſciences, then under the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb facs="tcp:168457:3"/>for I have of ſome, and thoſe very many had compaſſion, making a difference, truly I have, and I may ſpeak it with cheerfulneſſe in the preſence of God, who is a witneſſe within me to that truth I affirm, made a difference, and as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaketh, pluckt many out of the fire, the raging fire of perſecution, which did tyrannize over their conſciences, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached by an arbitrarineſſe of power upon their eſtates; And herein it is my purpoſe, as ſoon as I can remove impediments, and ſome weights that preſſe me down, to make a further progreſſe, and to diſcharge my promiſe to your Eminence in relation to that: And now I ſhall come to return your Eminence thanks, for your judicious choice of that perſon, to whom you have entruſted our weighteſt affairs, an affair wherein your Eminence is concerned, though not in equall degree and meaſure with my ſelf: I muſt confeſſe that I had ſome doubts of its ſucceſſe, till provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cleared them to me by the effects; I was not truly, and to ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly, without doubtings, and ſhall not be aſhamed to give your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence the grounds I had for ſuch doubtings: I did fear that <hi>Barkley</hi> would not have been able to go through and carry on that work, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke had cool'd in his ſute, or condiſcended to his brother: I doubted alſo, that thoſe Inſtructions which I ſent over with 290, were not clear enough as to expreſſions (affairs here denying me leiſure at that time to be ſo particular, as to ſome circumſtances I would). If I am not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken greatly miſtaken in his character, as I received it from your Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that fire which is kindled between them now, will not ask bellows to blow it and keep it burning: But what I think further neceſſary in this matter, I will ſend your Eminence by <hi>Lockart:</hi> And now I ſhall boaſt to your Eminence my ſecuritie upon a well-builded confidence in the Lord; for I diſtruſt not, but if this breach be widened a little more, and this difference fomented with ſome caution, in reſpect of the perſons to be added to it, I diſtruſt not but that party which is already forſaken of God (as to any outward diſpenſations of merits) and noiſome to their Countrymen, will grow lower in the opinions of all the world. If I have troubled your Eminence too long in this, you may impute it to the reſentment of joy which I have for the iſſue of this affair, and wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with giving you aſſurance that I will never be backwards in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating, as becoms your Brother and Confederate, that I am your Servant</p>
